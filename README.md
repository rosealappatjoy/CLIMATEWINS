# Climate Change Prediction
## Objective
Climate Wins wants to use machine learning to predict the impact of climate change in Europe and possibly worldwide. As a data analyst, my job is to find the best resources for predicting climate changes where people live using machine learning methods
## Key Questions
- How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
- ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are
there any concerns specific to this project?
-  Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
-  Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on
a certain day?
